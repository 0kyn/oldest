OLDEST
====
A bookmarklet to quickly get you to the oldest commit page of a repo.

### Overview

Being able to quickly navigate to the oldest commit page in a repo is quite helpful. Go ahead and drag the [bookmarklet (link)](http://bpceee.github.io/oldest/) onto your bookmark bar and click it whenever you'd like to go to the first commit page of a repo.

### Credits
* Inspired by [INIT](https://github.com/FarhadG/init). However there is a limitation on api.github.com calls, so this bookmarklet parses the main page to get the commitID and count.
